My broad research interests are in Deep Learning and Autonomous Systems. Some of the areas I wish to work are,

* Data analytics and deep learning applications in real-world problem-solving
* AI and machine learning in agricultural technology, focusing on crop yield prediction and resource optimization
* Development of AI-driven models for autonomous systems, enhancing automation and efficiency
* Cybersecurity, with an emphasis on integrating security measures in AI and autonomous systems to address safety and privacy

**Comprehensive dataset of annotated rice panicle image from Bangladesh**  
**Description:** Mohammad Rifat Ahmmad Rashid, Md Shafayat Hossain, <b>MD Fahim </b>, Md Shajibul Islam, Rizvee Hassan Prito, Md Shahadat Anik Sheikh, Md Sawkat Ali, Mahamudul Hasan, Maheen Islam  
**Description:** Bangladesh's economy is primarily driven by the agriculture sector. Rice is one of the staple food of Bangladesh. The count of panicles per unit area serves as a widely used indicator for estimating rice yield, facilitating breeding efforts, and conducting phenotypic analysis. By calculating the number of panicles within a given area, researchers and farmers can assess crop density, plant health, and prospective production. The conventional method of estimating rice yields in Bangladesh is time-consuming, inaccurate, and inefficient. To address the challenge of detecting rice panicles, this article provides a comprehensive dataset of annotated rice panicle images from Bangladesh. Data collection was done by a drone equipped with a 4 K resolution camera, and it took place on April 25, 2023, in Bonkhoria Gazipur, Bangladesh. During the day, the drone captured the rice field from various heights and perspectives â€¦
